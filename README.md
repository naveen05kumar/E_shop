Install Django: First, you need to install Django. You can do this using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Copy code
pip install django
Create a Django Project: Once Django is installed, you can create a new Django project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

Copy code
django-admin startproject myproject
Replace myproject with the name of your project.

Navigate into the Project Directory: Move into the project directory by running:

bash
Copy code
cd myproject
Create a Django App: Django projects are made up of apps. Create a new app within your project by running:

Copy code
python manage.py startapp myapp
Replace myapp with the name of your app.

Define Models: In your app directory (myapp), open models.py and define your data models using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). This defines the structure of your database tables.

Create Database Tables: After defining your models, you need to create database tables based on those models. Run the following command to do so:

Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Create Views: Views are Python functions that take web requests and return web responses. Define your views in the views.py file of your app.

URL Configuration: Define URL patterns for your views. Create a urls.py file in your app directory and map URL patterns to your views.

Templates: Templates are HTML files that define the structure of your web pages. Create a templates directory within your app directory and add your HTML templates.

Static Files: Static files include CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. Create a static directory within your app directory to store static files.

Configure Settings: Open settings.py in your project directory to configure your Django project settings, including database settings, static files settings, etc.

Run the Development Server: You can run the Django development server to test your application locally. Run the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Access Your Application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view your Django application running locally.

Create Admin User: Django provides a built-in admin interface. Create a superuser to access the admin interface by running:

Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

Admin Interface: You can access the admin interface by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and logging in with the superuser credentials you just created. Here, you can manage your database records.
